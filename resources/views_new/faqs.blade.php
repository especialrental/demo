If it’s a malfunction of some sort in the rental property – plumbing, electricity, heating, A/C, water supply – call your local representative who can assess the situation and contact the right person for you. Also, our owners are all extremely responsible folks who will attend to whatever it is immediately. We depend on them to resolve problems, which they do. If something happens and they don’t, we don’t rent their house any more. In France “immediately” is a relative term. If it’s a Sunday in August, it’s not going to get attended to until Monday at the earliest, even if the owner does his damnedest to resolve the matter.<br />
If it’s a relatively minor matter, call your local representative who may be able to fix it right away.</p>
